BIN in HOME
===========

There are a lot of good configuration management tools for linux, but sometimes a single script can be handy.
That is the philosophy behind these old, small scripts that I've written.

Scripts
-------

##android_mount.pl

It can mount and/or umount an Andorid device on Ubuntu 12.04 linux.

Usage: `./andorid-mount.pl [mount|umount]`

##clean-home.pl

Home directory maintenance script for Ubuntu 12.04, it just collects and deletes several files.

##my-stuff.pl

It mounts and/or umounts my encfs file system.

Usage: `./my-stuff [mount|umount]`
