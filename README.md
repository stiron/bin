BIN in HOME
===========

There are a lot of good configuration management tools for linux, but sometimes a single script can be handy.

Please do not forget the UNIX philosophy that one tool for one task (or something similar).
That is the philosophy behind these old, small scripts that I've written to make my life easier.

Scripts
-------

##android_mount.pl

It can mount and/or umount an Andorid device on Ubuntu 12.04 linux.

Usage: `./andorid-mount.pl [mount|umount]`

##clean-home.pl

Home directory maintenance script for Ubuntu 12.04, it just collects and deletes several files.

##my-stuff.pl

It mounts and/or umounts my encfs file system.

Usage: `./my-stuff [mount|umount]`
